description: "Welcome to the NekoSauce documentation!"
---

NekoSauce helps you find an image's original source. You can use it's API to find these sources programatically.

## Is it free?

NekoSauce is free to use, but you can help us cover server costs by becoming a [donator](https://ko-fi.com/nekidev). This project consumes a lot of server resources, so the rate limit is quite restrictive in the `/search` endpoint, which is a request every 10 seconds.

## Bugs

This is a hobby project made by non-proffesionals, so it'll probably have bugs everywhere. It uses a lot of third-party libraries that are written in programming languages I don't know about, so if you find a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/nekosauce-dev/nekosauce/issues/new)!

## Suggestions

We're always open to suggestions! You can say hi on our <Tooltip tip="Check the sidebar at the right!">Discord</Tooltip> or send us an email to [hi@nekosauce.org](mailto:hi@nekosauce.org), we always read what is sent there :)

## Showcase

There aren't any important projects that are using NekoSauce yet since this is a fairly new project. If you want to showcase a project you've made using NekoSauce here, you can open a PR at [GitHub](https://github.com/nekosauce-dev/Documentation).

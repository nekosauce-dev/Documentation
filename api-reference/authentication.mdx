NekoSauce's authentication is done using API keys. Each user has a completely random string assigned that is used to identify them in API requests.

To authenticate your API requests, you need to provide the following header:

```http
Authorization: ApiKey <api-key>
```

Not all endpoints require you to add an API key. E.g. `/api/sources`.

<Note>Currently, only beta testers (donators) have access to API keys.</Note>
